Quisk Version 3.6.4 September 2012
==================================
I added Hamlib control to Quisk.  Set your digital or logging program to rig2,
device localhost:4575.  See the Help and docs.html.  This is used to control Quisk
from other digital mode programs such as WSPR.

I added the Y scale to the graph above the waterfall.

Quisk can now record the speaker audio and the digital samples to a WAV file.  Set the
file names using the config screen, and then use the "FileRec" button to start recording.
Press the Help button for more information.

Quisk Version 3.6.3 July 2012
=============================
Thanks to Steve Murphy, KB8RWQ for the patch adding additional color control, and for his 
dark color design. 

I am using Quisk with my AR8600 receiver 10.7 MHz IF output as a general coverage receiver.
My config file is n2adr/quisk_conf_8600.py.  This covers the VHF and UHF bands, and so
I needed to add some FM repeater and scanner features.  I added a Squelch button for FM.
Right-click the button to adjust the squelch level.  The Squech and AGC buttons
are combined to save space.  The new configuration file items freq_spacing and
freq_base are used to round frequencies to channel spacings on VHF.  There is scanner
logic in my config file.  You should look at this if you use Quisk with a transverter for
the higher bands.  With my hardware it is able to scan known repeater frequencies jumping
across bands as it scans.  The 960 ksps rate of Quisk and HiQSDR is very useful at VHF
and higher.

I added tabs to the config screen, and cleaned it up.

I added a record and playback button.  Press Record to start a new recording of radio
sound.  The maximum recording length is set in the config file, and the default is 15
seconds.  After this limit, the most recent 15 seconds of sound is retained.  To play
the recorded sound, press the Play button.  If you are transmitting, the recorded sound
is transmitted provided the microphone and playback sample rate are both 48000 sps.  The
transmitted recorded sound is not subjected to the usual audio processing.  That means
that you can play another ham's audio back and give him/her a good idea of how it sounds.

Quisk Version 3.6.2 May 2012
============================
I added a display of the filter bandwidth to the graph screen.  This is based on code
provided by Terry Fox, WB4JFI.  Thanks Terry!  See the file quisk_conf_defaults.py.

I added detailed information on each sound device to the config screen.  The Test
button now generates AM and FM as well as CW and SSB.

The receive filtering has been re-written to improve the shape of the filters and to
reduce the CPU time.  Quisk now runs on my fan-less Shuttle Atom machine at speeds
up to 480 ksps.  The CW filters are particularly nice.

Quisk Version 3.6.1 April 2012
==============================
There is a new "DGTL" mode to send Quisk audio to an external digital mode program
such as Fldigi.  Read the file quisk_conf_defaults.py to see the new config file
options available.  Use the Help button for basic information, and see docs.html.

I changed the 60 meter operation to agree with new FCC rules (for the USA).  See
the configuration file for items to control 60 meters.

Quisk Version 3.6.0 March 2012
==============================
There are no new user features in this release, and no changes to the HiQSDR code.
This version adds a new feature for those writing C-language extension modules
that need to access C code from the _quisk extension module.  Examples are the
SDR-IQ and the Charleston extension modules.  This feature was requested by
Maitland Bottoms, AA4HS, and he also provided patches.

Previously, symbols from the _quisk module were linked to sub-modules with the
C linker.  Now _quisk exports symbols using the Python CObject or Capsule
interface.  The documentation is in import_quisk_api.c.  Only minimal changes
to extension modules are required, as most changes are in _quisk.  The linker
method still works on Linux, but the new interface is highly recommended.

Quisk Version 3.5.12 February 2012
==================================
There are no changes to Quisk, but this version includes the new Quisk VNA program
that enables you to use my original transceiver hardware and the newer HiQSDR
hardware as a vector network analyzer.  Use "python quisk_vna.py" to run it.

Quisk Version 3.5.11 December 2011
==================================
I fixed a bug that caused the microphone to freeze when sending the mic sound to
the SoftRock for transmit.

Quisk Version 3.5.10 December 2011
==================================
Lucian Langa contributed a patch to return the primary display size for dual
displays.  If you decreased graph_width for dual displays you will need to change it
back to 0.80 (or similar).

I improved the transmit audio filters to reduce spurs and decrease processing time.
The mic sample rate can now be either 48000 (as before) or 8000 samples per second.
The plan is to make Quisk run effectively on small laptops or even tablet computers.
Remember to adjust mic_clip and mic_preemphasis in your config file.

Quisk Version 3.5.9 November 2011
=================================
I fixed a bug in Windows that occurs only when using the mic for transmit.

Quisk Version 3.5.8 October 2011
================================
The Windows version is now equal to the Linux version, and transmits properly.

I added a parameter agc_off_gain to the config file.  It controls the audio gain
when AGC is off.  Reduce it if sound with AGC off is too loud.  Note that even with
AGC off, the output is limited to the clip level.  I made some other improvements to AGC.

I added FM transmit.  The modulation index can be set in your config file.

I made some improvements to demodulation, and to the SSB transmit filter.   I fixed an
array out of bounds bug in transmit.

Quisk Version 3.5.7 September 2011
==================================
This is a quick release to fix two bugs in 3.5.6, the message "expected integer" and
faint audio for FM.  I also added a new parameter agc_max_gain to the default
configuration file to control the scale of the AGC slider.

Quisk Version 3.5.6 September 2011
==================================
The Spot button now has a level adjustment instead of fixed values.  Right-click the
button to adjust.  There are now three buttons with a slider adjustment, namely AGC,
Spot and the right-most filter button.

I added a feature to measure and remove any DC component in the UDP samples.  I fixed a
problem with the waterfall display when zoomed and using band up-down.

There is a new adjustable  AGC control.   Right click it to show the slider adjustment.  The
full up position corresponds to the old AGC 1.

I removed the 1650 Hertz offset when transmitting SSB.  It was not necessary and cluttered the code.

Quisk Version 3.5.5 July 2011
=============================
These changes only affect the N2ADR 2010 transceiver and the improved version, the HiQSDR.

I moved all the files into a new package directory hiqsdr.  The old n2adr directory
has only the special files I use at my shack.  Please change your config file as follows:

from hiqsdr import quisk_hardware		# Special hardware file
use_rx_udp = 1	# Use this for the N2ADR-2010
use_rx_udp = 2	# Use this for the HiQSDR

The sample config file quisk_conf.py in hiqsdr can be used as is for the HiQSDR.
There is a new dictionary tx_level in the config file to set the transmit level.  See
quisk_conf_defaults.py for other features that can be set for the HiQSDR.

There is a new FPGA firmare version 1.1 available to support the new HiQSDR features.
Note that your firmware version is shown on the Config screen.  It is not necessary to
update your firmware unless you use the HiQSDR and you want the new HiQSDR control lines
to work.  If you do update your firmware, you must run Quisk 3.5.5 or later.

Quisk Version 3.5.4 June 2011
=============================
I added another slider labeled "Zo" to zoom (expand) the graph screen scale
so that narrow signals can be examined.  The center of the graph is changed
to the tuning frequency when zoom is turned on.  To cancel zoom, move the
slider back to the bottom position.  You can tune as usual even if zoom is on.

I put the band buttons on one line so I could add more control buttons.

Quisk Version 3.5.3 May 2011
============================
I added "Documents" as a possible config file location (for Windows 7).

These changes are specific to my 2009/2010 transceiver hardware:
I now detect and display the firmware version.  The files conf_transceiver.py
and hardware_transceiver.py are now the basic config and hardware files for my
transceiver.  The spot button now appears without a special widgets file, so no
widgets file is necessary.  The file quisk_hardware.py is still the hardware file
used in my station, but it is mostly useful as an example of what is possible,
not as a starting point for use by others.


Quisk Version 3.5.2 April 2011
==============================
I added code from Ethan Blanton, KB8OJH, to provide direct frequency control
of the Si570 chip in many SoftRocks.  I added AM transmit and improved AM
receive.  I added FM de-emphasis to receive.  I added a noise blanker.

It is now possible to delay samples (tx_channel_delay) and correct the amplitude
and phase for the sound card play device (SoftRock transmit).  Unfortunately
receive sound card corrections will need to be re-entered.

The filter bandwidths for each mode can now be set in the config file.  And
you can right-click the right-most filter button to adjust its bandwidth.

Quisk Version 3.5.1 February 2011
=================================
The phase correction control has been improved to allow multiple correction
points per band.  Unfortunately this will require re-entering corrections.

I added mic_preemphasis and mic_clip to the config file to control Tx audio processing.

Quisk Version 3.5.0 January 2011
================================
Starting with this version, a Windows version of Quisk is available (alpha code).
I changed the amplitude/phase correction control, and added config file
options (rx_max_phase_correct) to control the maximum available correction.

Quisk Version 3.4.14 January 2011
=================================
The "alsa:" names can now be used for mixer settings.  I added simplified
config and hardware files for my 2010 transceiver hardware. I moved the one
sample delay for some sound cards into the config file instead of using the
#define FIX_H101 (which remains for backward compatibility).  I added more
buttons "GraphP2" to the Graph button to activate a peak hold function.  There
are config file options graph_peak_hold_1 and _2 to control the time constant.

Quisk Version 3.4.13 December 2010
==================================
I decreased the microphone speech processing preemphasis and clipping.
I added a config parameter key_poll_msec to control the SoftRock USB
poll for key status.  I improved the config screen.  Alsa names can
now be strings like "alsa:NVidia" that match the card/device info.
Thanks to Joachim Schneider, DB6QS, I made some improvements to SoftRock
USB control.

Quisk Version 3.4.11 November 2010
===============================
Thanks to Sid Boyce, G3VBV, for sending me SoftRock hardware to work with.
The "mic_play" logic was re-written so that transmit I/Q samples can be
sent from a sound card to hardware that uses QSD up-conversion.  I added
USB access through pyusb to control recent SoftRock models.  A new package
"softrock" directly supports several SoftRock models.  

Change Spot Button to transmit at carrier frequency.

Add a Split button to enable split receive and transmit frequencies.

Fix band change data for pan adapter users.

Try to make easy_install work better.

Quisk Version 3.4.8 August 2010
===============================
A new config file option "playback_rate" can set the radio sound play rate.

I added a button to the config screen to change the decimation rate for
hardware that supports this.  See the new "VarDecim" methods in
quisk_hardware_model.py.  I added this feature to the SDR-IQ hardware
file sdriqpkg/quisk_hardware.py, and to n2adr/quisk_hardware.py.

Thanks to John Nogatch AC6SL for a bug fix.

Quisk Version 3.4.6 July 2010
=============================
I improved the mouse tuning by eliminating a tendency to tune backward.

I made the sdriq extension and my n2adr code into packages in the directories
"sdriqpkg" and "n2adr".  The new package architecture will make it easier for
authors to write Quisk extensions.  See the example config files quisk_conf_sdriq.py
and quisk_conf_n2adr.py to see how to change your imports:

  from sdriqpkg import sdriq
  from sdriqpkg import quisk_hardware
  from n2adr import quisk_hardware
  from n2adr import quisk_widgets

Thanks to Terry Fox, WB4JFI, for improvements to Quisk:
    Code to support the Charleston hardware (libusb-dev required).
    Code to add a third FFT data block.

Quisk Version 3.4.3 June 2010
=============================
The hardware open() method now returns a string for the config screen.  If
you have a custom hardware file, create a string or return the base class string.

I made the SDR-IQ code into a separate Python extension module "sdriq".
This module can serve as a model for other hardware extensions.  It is
the model for the Charleston hardware extension module.  The sdriq.so
file needs _quisk.so, so put both in the same directory.

I corrected the decimation for sample rates greater than 240 ksps, and
improved the filters for all decimations to reduce "images".

The following changes are only relevant if you use the SDR-IQ for capture:

  You need to add these lines to your config file (see quisk_hardware_defaults.py):
        import quisk_hardware_sdriq as quisk_hardware
        display_fraction = 0.85
  There is now a special hardware file for the SDR-IQ.  If you have a
  custom hardware file that uses the SDR-IQ you need to use
  quisk_hardware_sdriq as its base class (instead of quisk_hardware_model).

[See version 3.4.5 for further SDR-IQ changes]

Quisk Version 3.4.2 May 2010
============================
The config file has a new option to add an external demodulation module.  I
I added the ability to play in stereo, and corrected the sidetone logic.

The config file has a new option to add a full duplex button.

I added the ability to use PortAudio for sound card access.  PortAudio
can also be used to connect Quisk to other programs.

I added a key up delay to the is_key_down() serial port code and fixed a
sound card CW bug.

A new config file entry can make amplitude/phase corrections independent
of band.  This is needed for a panadapter.

I fixed the compressed graph labels at high sample rates.

Quisk Version 3.3.7 April 2010
=================================
If you get samples from a UDP port, you can specify the decimation rate in the
config file.

If you send samples to a sound card for transmit, CW now works (as does SSB).

Quisk Version 3.3.6 February 2010
=================================
I added BandEdge to the config file, and added code to Quisk to make the
frequency and band changes more rational.  I changed the config file
attribute freqTime to bandTime (see changes).

You can now define a class named "Hardware" in your config file, and then
you don't need a separate hardware file.  This is only recommended for
simple hardware needs.  See docs.html.

If you use the microphone and send samples with UDP, the audio is now
centered at 1650 Hertz, and you must add/subtract this offset when
setting the transmit frequency.

A number of valuable patches were submitted by Andrew Nilsson, VK6JBL,
and these were incorporated into Quisk:

  The band buttons displayed can be changed in the config file (bandLabels).

  The 6 meter band was added (change bandLabels to show it).

  Turn on add_imd_button in the config file to generate 2-tone test signals.

  The two new functions QS.capt_channels(i, q) and QS.play_channels(i, q)
  will set the capture and playback channel numbers at any time.

  If you set the key method to "", the new function QS.set_key_down(1) will
  set the key state up or down.  This enables you change the key state using
  either C or Python; for example, to add a "MOX" button.

  The microphone samples can now be output to a sound card for transmit.  See
  the additional items in the config file.

  The new config file parameter mouse_tune_method causes mouse drag tuning
  to change the VFO frequency, not the Quisk tuning frequency.

I moved microphone_name and tx_ip (for the microphone) to the config
file from the hardware file so that all the mic parameters are together.

Quisk Version 3.3.1 December 2009
=================================

For sound card input, I added controls to correct amplitude and phase
balance.  Press the new button on the config screen.  A different
correction is saved for each band.  See the help file.

I added the new band "Audio".  It sets the VFO frequency to
zero and is meant to be used with a sound card.  I changed the WWV and CHU
bands to a new Time band.  The time frequencies are named freqTime and can
be changed in your config file.

In the file quisk_conf_defaults.py I changed the default for persistent_state
to True, and added graph_width=0.8 to specify the graph width.

A period "." in the frequency entry box means megahertz.

Quisk Version 3.3.0 November 2009
=================================

I fixed a bug in the SDR-IQ decimation that produced slight audio
distortion at decimations other than 500.

If the play device is the null string "", Quisk no longer tunes and
demodulates the signal.  This saves CPU cycles when Quisk is used
as a panadapter.

I added decimation (reduction of sample rate) before the filters so that
Quisk can handle higher sample rates or slower computers.

I made the waterfall into a splitter window with a graph display at the top.
There are new attributes in the config file to control this feature.

The numeric value of Ys and Yz are now shown so that the values can be added
to the config file more easily.

There is a new config option to save the state (band, frequency, etc.) on
exit, and restore it on startup.  Only certain bits of state are saved; the
others are still taken from the config file.

The default config file sets fft_size_multiplier to zero, and this specifies
that Quisk should calculate it for you.

Quisk Version 3.2.3 September 2009
==================================

Fixed a bug that prevented tuning the SDR-IQ when using the
default hardware file.  Started adding code to capture sound
from a UDP socket.

Quisk Version 3.2.2 June 2009
=============================

The microphone access was re-written to make it work with more
sound cards.  The config file has a new parameter "mic_channel_I"
to specify which sound card channel is used for the mic.

Added Documentation.html.  Fixed lack of poll to ReturnFrequency().

Quisk Version 3.2 May 2009
==========================

Quisk now uses wxPython instead of Tkinter for its graphical
user interface.  You must install the python-wxgtk2.8 package.
Get the latest version available.  If you still want to run
the Tkinter version, it is quisk_tk.py.  The wxPython version
is much faster.

Quisk now runs in two threads; a GUI thread and a sound thread.

I moved the colors to the config file so you can change the
colors more easily.


Quisk Version 3.1  April 2009
=============================

New hardware file to control the AOR AD8600.

I added filtering to FM audio to remove CTCSS tones and provide
-6 dB / octave de-emphasis.

I removed the tkdirect C-language module and replaced it with a
pure Python equivalent.  This reduces compilation problems.

I improved the speed of the screen updates so that Quisk will run
without clicks on slower computers.


Quisk Version 3.0.0  April 2009
===============================

Thanks to Leigh L. Klotz, Jr. WA5ZNU, my special hardware control was
removed to separate files so that Quisk now has a cleaner design that
is more useful to others.
